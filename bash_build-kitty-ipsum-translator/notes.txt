> OR 1> = stdout
>> = stdout (concatenate)
cat = print file

2> = stderr

| = pipe output of first command into the input of the 2nd command

wc = word count (lines,words,bytes)
wc -l = line count
wc -m = char count
wc -w = word count

grep = search
grep -c 'expression' <filename> = count of lines that match case
grep -o 'expression' <filename> = print all matches only
sample expression = meow[a-z]* -> meow(+anything alphabetical after)

grep + wc
grep -o 'expression' <filename> | wc -l = count of matches

sed = stream editor (edits stdout of the input)
sed 's/regexp/replacement/' <filename> = update text if found in file
sed 's/<text to edit>/<text to change to>/i' <filename> = update text if found in file (case-insensitive)
sed -r = use extended regex

Sample code
grep -n 'meow[a-z]*' kitty_ipsum_1.txt | sed -r 's/([0-9]+).*/\1/' = Print line numbers only where match
-> Look-up meow* and print out the lines they appear with the line number | piped into sed, which will match the line number and just print out the line numbers only

grep -o 'meow[a-z]*' kitty_ipsum_2.txt | wc -l = Print count of occurrences
